Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm Assignment 

This project aims to use recursion in Floyd Warshall's algorithm and performning unit,functional and performance experience to compared it with the imperative and itertools implementation.



Before you start:

Ensure that you have installed the necessary packages listed in 'requirements.txt' prior to starting.

Explanation:

The function can be used from the collections of list used to represent the graph (provided by the University of Liverpool)

Graph provided by University of Liverpool 

graph = [[0, 7, INF, 8] ,[INF, 0, 5, INF],[INF, INF, 0, 2],[INF, INF, INF, 0]]

Definitions: 

INF - Represents the infinite distance i.e the edges that don't exist.

 0  - Represents the nodes in the graph. In the graph above, we notice four "0", meaning that we have 4 nodes.
 
Numbers- The other values(7,5,8,2) represents the edge's weight, representing the direct path to theat node.
